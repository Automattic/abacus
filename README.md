### Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks have been put in place via `husky` which will run the `precommit` NPM script. This script runs `lint-staged` but could be used to run different or more commands. The `lint-staged` command will run commands on only the staged files of the commit according to the configuration. The `lint-staged` configuration is in `package.json`.

### Testing

**test:unit**

Runs the unit tests with Jest.

The unit tests are found throughout the project excluding tests in the `__tests__` and `e2e` directory. (Tests in those directories are for integration and end-to-end tests.)

```sh
npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit -- --coverage
npm run test:unit -- --watch
```
