# Experimentation Platform API

## Models

The models in this directory were initially generated by the OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech) using the `typescript-fetch` generator with the configuration from https://github.com/Automattic/experimentation-platform/blob/master/docs/experiments-api-swagger.yaml.

**Steps**

Here are the steps to replicate how the files were initially generated.

```sh
mkdir experimentation-platform-api
cd experimentation-platform-api
npm init -y
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -D
```

The YAML config was saved to the `experimentation-platform-api` directory as `experiments-api-swagger.yaml`.

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/openapi-generator generate -g typescript-fetch -o out -i experiments-api-swagger.yaml
```

This generates the code to the `out` sub-directory.

Select files where copied to this directory and modified as needed.
